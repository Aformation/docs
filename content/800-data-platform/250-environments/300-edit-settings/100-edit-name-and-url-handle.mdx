In a project in the Prisma Data Platform, you can change the environment name and URL handle and modify how the environment appears in the interface and in the URL that leads to the environment

The environment name appears in the **Environments** drop-down menu and the **Environments** tab of the project settings.

The URL handle appears in the URL for the project environment.

For example:

```
https://cloud.prisma.io/<github_username>/<project_handle>/<environment_name>
```

* `github_username`. Your GitHub username.
* `project_name`. The URL handle of a project in the Prisma Data Platform.
* `environment_name`. The URL handle of a project environment in the Prisma Data Platform.
