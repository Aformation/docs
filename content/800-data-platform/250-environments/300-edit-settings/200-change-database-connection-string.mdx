For each environment of your project, you can switch to using another database by changing the database connection string.

<Admonition type="alert">

It takes some time before new connection strings take effect. Because of this, allow several minutes before you start testing the new database.

## Prerequisites

* You must have the [Project owner](/data-platform/members/user-roles) or [Admin](/data-platform/members/user-roles) role for the project to edit a database connection string for any of the environments.

## Steps

1. In the Prisma Data Platform, open a project.
2. In the upper left, click the **Projects** drop-down and select **Project settings**.
3. Select the **Environments** tab.
4. Click the three-dot menu of an environment and select **Settings**.
5. In **Connection string**, paste a new connection string.
6. (Optional) From Static IPs, select **Enabled** if your database is behind a firewall and you can only configure external access from specific IP addresses. Copy the IP addresses and add them to the allowlist of your database.
7. Click **Update Database Connection**.

## Result

Your database connection string for the environment is now updated.
