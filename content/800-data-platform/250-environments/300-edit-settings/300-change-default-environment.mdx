<TopBlock>

When you or your team members open a project and use the **Data Browser**, **Query Console**, and **Schema Viewer**, you do so with the database, Data Proxy location, and GitHub repository that you configure for the default environment.

When you first create a project, the first and default environment has the name **Production**.

Later, when you add more environments, you can change the default to any of the added environments.

## Prerequisites

You must have the [Project owner](/data-platform/members/user-roles) or [Admin](/data-platform/members/user-roles) role for the project to change the default environment.

## Steps

1. In the Prisma Data Platform, open a project.
2. In the upper left, click the **Projects** drop-down and select **Project settings**.
3. Select the **Environments** tab.
4. Click the three-dot menu of an environment and select **Make default**.
